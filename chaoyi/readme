* Training
1. Sasha dataset preprocessing:
	- create pseudo 3D slices (3 slices) as inputs.
	- save pseudo 3d slices as ".png" files.
2. Dataset folder structure
	Level 0 : xxx/SashaDataset
	Level 1 : training or testing
	Level 2 : ScanIndex (1011pb_m00, 1017sm_m48, ...)
	Level 3 : t1 or flair or les_bin (les_bin is the ground truth)
	Level 4 : sliceId.png (1.png, 2.png, ...) 
3. Set dataset_root parameter in train.py 
	DATASET_ROOT = 'xxx/SashaDataset'
4. run "python train.py" to start training
5. best_model would be saved under "ExpResults" folder

================================================================================================================
* Inference
6. copy "sasha_dataset_setting" from previous code package to the root folder 
7. copy "best_model.pkl" from "ExpResults" folder to the root folder, and run "python inference.py"
   predicted_lesion_masks will be generated as "output_sample"
8. run "python inference_eval.py"
   subject_dice and voxel_dice will be calculated.



* I also include two models trained previously with these source code. The prediction masks generated 
are included as well.
